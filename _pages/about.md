Hi there! I'm Daniele Malitesta, a Ph.D. Student at Polytechnic University of Bari (Italy). 

My main research topics are **Graph Learning** and **Multimedia Recommender Systems**, but I'm also interested in Adversarial Machine Learning and Deep Learning. I'm working with Prof. Tommaso Di Noia and Prof. Yashar Deldjoo.

# Education
I got my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and Automation Engineering in 2017 (full marks with honors) with a thesis in Electrical Communications entitled *"Performance Evaluation of Data-Centric Networks based upon Semantic Naming Algorithms"*.

Then, I got my Master's Degree in Computer Science Engineering in 2019 (full marks with honors) with a thesis in Logic and Artificial Intelligence entitled *"Novel Approaches to Image Compression via Deep Learning"*.

From January 2020 to November 2020 I worked as Research Assistant at Polytechnic of Bari. 

Starting from November 2020, I'm a Ph.D. Student working on Graph Learning techniques for Multimedia Recommender Systems.
