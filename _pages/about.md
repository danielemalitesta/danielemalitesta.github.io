Hi there! I'm Daniele Malitesta, a postdoc researcher at CentraleSupélec, Inria (Université Paris-Saclay) working with Prof. Fragkiskos Malliaros.

Previously, I pursued my PhD in Electrical and Information Engineering at Politecnico di Bari under the supervision of Prof. Tommaso Di Noia.

My main research topics are _Graph Representation Learning_, _Recommender Systems_, and _Multimodal Deep Learning_.

# Upcoming events
* _[Jan 24, 2025]_ I'll give again the talk entitled "**Graph-based Imputation to Address Missing Modalities in Multimodal Recommendation**" at the Data Science and Mining Team at the Laboratoire d'Informatique of École Polytechnique in Paris!  
* _[Jan 16, 2025]_ I'll give a talk entitled "**Graph-based Imputation to Address Missing Modalities in Multimodal Recommendation**" at the HCAI research group in Linz!  
* _[Nov 29, 2024]_ Me, along with colleagues from CentraleSupélec, Ecole Polytechnique, CNRS, Télécom, and Entalpic will host the LoG 2024 Meetup in Paris. Check our [event website](https://sites.google.com/view/learning-on-graph-paris-meetup/home).  
* _[Oct 22, 2024]_ I will present our short paper "**Do We Really Need to Drop Items with Missing Modalities in Multimodal Recommendation?**" at CIKM 2024 in Boise, Idaho.

# Latest news
